# Introduction 

Today's living and business environments challenge enterprises to provide efficient customer service. Queueing systems with the Join the Shortest Queue strategy, is a research area in probability theory, optimization and service process management. In the context of queueing systems, this strategy is used to minimize customer waiting time by selecting the shortest queue upon arrival for service.

In this research paper we will describe the main methods of solving problems about queueing systems. We will consider both classical and modern approaches to modeling and analyzing such systems, as well as their advantages and limitations.


## Research Objectives and Tasks

The main objective of this research is to give an overview of the main methods for solving problems in queueing systems with this strategy. 

As part of this goal, we have set the following objectives:

1.To study the basic principles of queueing systems with this strategy.
2.	To analyze existing approaches and methods of solving problems of queueing systems.
3. Analyze examples of successful application of this strategy in various fields of activity. 3.
4.To evaluate the advantages and limitations of the strategy and its impact on the quality of customer service.
5.	Examine current trends and innovative approaches to optimizing queueing systems using this strategy.

## Research Relevance

The study of queueing systems is highly relevant in today's world. Effective queue management plays a key role in ensuring customer satisfaction, optimizing business processes and enhancing the competitiveness of enterprises.

With the rapidly developing world and changing consumer preferences, continuous improvement of queue system management methods and tools is necessary. 

Thus, this study is significant not only from a scientific, but also from a practical point of view, as its results can be used for service in various areas of activity, which will ultimately contribute to improving the quality of customer service and operational efficiency.
